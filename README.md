# ReactProject
A simple website using React

Mimics a restaurant's website, where you can order food online.  Single-page site (for now), where you can view the menu, add/remove items from your cart, and view your cart.

To-do:
- Make the menu dynamic (updates based on an external database, or a backend UI for the restaurant owner to use)
- Make a 'check-out' component(s)
-
